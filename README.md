## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # If you have the project files, navigate to the project directory
   cd wellness-log-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Postman Mock Server**
   - Follow the detailed guide in `postman/README.md`
   - Import the Postman collection
   - Create a mock server
   - Get your mock server URL

4. **Configure API URL**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in project root
   echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-mock-server-url.mock.pstmn.io" > .env
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - The app will make real HTTP requests to your Postman mock server

### Building for Production

```bash
# Create an optimized production build
npm run build

# The build files will be in the 'build' directory
# You can serve them with any static file server
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run the test suite
npm test
```

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

## API Documentation

### Postman Mock Server Endpoints

The application uses **Postman Mock Server** for realistic API interactions:

#### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login with email/password
- `POST /auth/signup` - User registration

#### Wellness Logs
- `GET /wellness-logs` - Fetch user's wellness logs
- `POST /wellness-logs` - Create new wellness log
- `DELETE /wellness-logs/{id}` - Delete a wellness log

### Setup Required
1. **Import** the Postman collection from `postman/`
2. **Create** a mock server in Postman
3. **Configure** the `.env` file with your mock server URL
4. **See** `postman/README.md` for detailed setup instructions

### Common Issues

1. **App won't start**: Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed and run `npm install`
2. **Blank page**: Check browser console for errors, try clearing localStorage
3. **Styles not loading**: Clear browser cache and restart the development server

### Data Storage

- Data is handled by Postman Mock Server responses
- Mock servers return static responses (data doesn't persist)
- This simulates real API behavior without requiring a backend
- For persistent data, a real backend database would be needed
